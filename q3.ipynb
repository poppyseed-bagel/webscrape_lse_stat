    "## Q3: LSE Department of Statistics (35 marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this question, we want to collect some data about LSE Statistics academic staff via web scraping, and find out the distribution of different types of staff, gender balance, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "Do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Data collection via web scraping] Use web scraping with Python modules `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to extract the information about the academic staff of the Department of Statistics from https://www.lse.ac.uk/Statistics/People (and the linked pages). For simplicity, we only consider:\n",
    "    > * All the staff under the tab \"Academic faculty\" \n",
    "    > * Guest lecturers/teachers and LSE fellows under the tab \"Academic associates - Emeritus Professors, Guest Lecturers and Visiting Staff\" \n",
    "        * i.e. we DO NOT consider any of the emeritus or visiting staff, as they are less involved and/or only joining for a short period\n",
    "\n",
    "    For each staff fulfilling the requirements above, do the following:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * (a) Get the URL of the staff's page from \"More information\". Example:\n",
    "    <img src=\"figs/people.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For example, for Dr. James Abdey, the link is https://www.lse.ac.uk/Statistics/People/Dr-James-Abdey\n",
    "        * You may get some shorter version of the path first (like `Statistics/People/Dr-James-Abdey`), but you can construct the full URL from the short version\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * (b) With the URLs collected from (a), use web scraping with python modules `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape the following information and store the result in a `pd.DataFrame` with 3 columns:\n",
    "        * Name of the staff (e.g. James Abdey, with or without the title prefix)\n",
    "        * Job title (e.g. Associate Professorial Lecturer)\n",
    "        * Gender - depending on the page, you may be able to deduce the gender of the staff from the content of \"About me\"\n",
    "            * You may want to use `np.nan` to represent those you cannot find the gender automatically\n",
    "        \n",
    "        <img src=\"figs/james.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Data exploration] Calculate the descriptive statistics on title and gender. Based on the descriptive statistics _only_, answer the following:\n",
    "    * Are there any issues with the data collected? If yes, what are they?\n",
    "    * Is the gender ratio of academic staff close to 50:50 within the department?\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. [Data wrangling] Cleaning and organise the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * (a) Handle any issues of the data collected from part (1) based on what you have discovered in part (2), including:\n",
    "        * If you have discovered that you did not collect the data correctly in part (1), fix it\n",
    "            * If you are not able to fix the code in part (1), at the very least try to fix the data manually so that you can get reasonable results (and marks) in part (3) and (4)\n",
    "        * If there is any missing data, handle them _appropriately_ and explain your rationale\n",
    "    * (b) Extract the \"role\" and the \"rank\" of each staff from the `pd.DataFrame` in (3a):\n",
    "        * \"Role\" of the staff (based on https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Human-Resources/The-recruitment-toolkit/Role-profiles): \n",
    "            * \"teaching\" (the job title should have the words like \"Lecturer\", \"Teacher\", \"Teaching Fellow\" or \"LSE Fellow\"), e.g. Associate Professorial Lecturer\n",
    "            * \"faculty\" (the job title should have the _word_ \"Professor\"), e.g. Assistant Professor\n",
    "        * \"Rank\" of the staff: \n",
    "            * \"non-tenure\" (non tenure-track, should contain the words like \"Guest\" or \"Fellow\"), e.g. Guest Teacher, LSE fellow\n",
    "            * \"assistant\" (entry-level tenure-track, should contain the word \"Assistant\"), e.g. Assistant Professor\n",
    "            * \"associate\" (mid-level tenure-track, should contain the word \"Associate\"), e.g. Associate Professorial Lecturer\n",
    "            * \"full\" (senior-level tenure-track, does not have any of the keywords above), e.g. Professor\n",
    "        \n",
    "    and put the information about the role and rank as two additional columns to the data frame in (3a)\n",
    "    * (c) Store the `pd.DataFrame` from (3b) into a csv file in the `data` folder, with the name of the file to be `lse_statistics_2022mmdd.csv` with `mm` the month and `dd` the day you have collected the data. This file will help us to verify your result\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. [Simple analysis] Use the `pd.DataFrame` from part (3b), find out if the gender ratio depends on the roles and/or the rank\n",
    "    * Based on your results in this part, do you think the Department of Statistics has a good gender balance among its staff?\n",

    "    \n",
    "Please state the limitations of your answers."

Qiwei Yao had \"he\" pronouns in his bio once, but it was at the very beginning of a paragraph. In order to ensure that the pronoun \"he\" was not being collected from the middle of a word such as \"there\" I added a space before and after it to ensure it was a standalone word. Even though I've tried replace the new line character with a space the code is still not picking up on it, so I will also manually change his gender. Since all the genders we're changing are to male, I will use a blanket line of code associated with the NaN genders."
